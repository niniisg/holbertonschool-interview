# Linked list cycle

Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

Requirements

## General 

 - Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs 
 - All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
 - Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the
   flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
 - All your files should end with a new line
 -  Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using
   betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl  
 - You are not allowed to use global variables
 - No more than 5 functions per file   
 - In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples.
   You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push
   them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We
   will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might
   be different from the one shown in the examples
 - The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your
   header file called lists.h 
 - Don’t forget to push your header file
